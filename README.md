Developed in Microsoft Visual Studio
# Simple particle simulation created in C++ and SFML.

# Overview:

Particle simulation that utilizes verlet integration to compute and solve collisions between the constraint and circles, using SFML to render the window and circles. Can handle 100's of circles at once. Capped at 60 FPS due to the method of substepping. 

Served as a project for me to learn the C++ programming language.

# Features:

FPS Counter

Total Time Elapsed Counter

Object Counter

# Controls:

Escape: Exit the program

Left Click: Spawn a random circle with a radius of 15.0f - 10.0f

A: Quickly spawn multiple circles with a radius of 15.0f - 10.0f
